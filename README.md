The Weather Forecast App is a clean and responsive web application that allows users to search for any city and get real-time weather data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions like "Rain", "Clear", or "Cloudy". The app fetches data from a public weather API (like OpenWeatherMap) and dynamically updates the UI.
